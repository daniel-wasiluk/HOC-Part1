It was introduced at the Homebrew Computer Club, a gathering of electronics hobbyists in Palo Alto, California, and quickly gained popularity.<br> <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II" target="_blank">Apple II:</a> Building on the success of the Apple I, Wozniak designed the Apple II, launched in 1977. The Apple II was a major advancement over its predecessor, featuring color graphics, an open architecture, and an integrated keyboard. It was one of the first computers to come in a plastic case, setting a design standard for future personal computers. The Apple II's success propelled Apple into the forefront of the computing industry, cementing its reputation and establishing it as a key player in the market. Wozniak's design of the Apple II's hardware and software was pivotal, driving the personal computer revolution and making computing accessible to households and businesses.</p>
